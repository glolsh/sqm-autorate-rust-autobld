# sqm‑autorate‑rust‑hybrid

**sqm‑autorate‑rust‑hybrid** is an advanced Rust re‑implementation of the original sqm‑autorate tool. It dynamically adjusts CAKE SQM bandwidth settings by measuring real-time traffic load and latency. 

While the original tool was designed for fluctuating LTE/DOCSIS links, this **Hybrid** version is enhanced with high-precision measurement logic and safety constraints, making it equally effective for high-speed symmetric Fiber (FTTH) connections where maintaining the "bottleneck" on the router is critical for zero-bufferbloat performance.

## Features

* **Adaptive Rate Control**: Continuously monitors one‑way delay baselines and traffic load to tune both download and upload shaping rates in real-time.
* **Hybrid Per-Reflector Measurement**: 
    * **Smart Fallback**: Prefers high-precision **ICMP Timestamps (Type 13)** for one-way delay calculation.
    * **Dynamic Downgrade**: Automatically falls back to **ICMP Echo (Type 8)** on a per-reflector basis if Timestamps are filtered by the target (e.g., public DNS like 1.1.1.1).
    * **Auto-Promotion**: Periodically retries Timestamps to restore maximum precision if the network path allows.
* **Hardware Ceiling (Max Rate)**: Introduces `download_max_kbits` and `upload_max_kbits` to prevent capacity probing from exceeding physical link limits (e.g., 1Gbps Ethernet overhead or Cat 5e constraints), ensuring CAKE always remains in control.
* **Robust Reflector Logic**: Dynamic thresholding for reflector health. The system remains operational and quiet as long as at least one reflector is reachable, avoiding log spam in small-pool configurations.
* **Concurrent Architecture**: Dedicated threads for packet sending, receiving, baselining, and rate-control for sub-millisecond responsiveness.
* **Deep OpenWrt Integration**: 
    * Full UCI support via `/etc/config/sqm-autorate`.
    * Robust boolean parsing (supports `true/false`, `1/0`, `on/off`).
    * Environment-based logging configuration.
* **Minimal Dependencies**: Relies on a small set of high-performance Rust crates (`anyhow`, `neli`, `rustix`), requiring no external shell scripts or heavy libraries.

## Configuration Options (UCI)

| Option | Description | Default |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `enabled` | Enable/Disable the service | `0` |
| `interface` | Interface to manage (e.g., `eth1`) | (required) |
| `download_base_kbits` | Starting download speed | `750000` |
| `download_max_kbits` | **Hard ceiling** for download probing (0 = Unlimited) | `0` |
| `download_min_percent`| Minimum speed during congestion | `50` |

## Installation

### 1. Native Rust build

1. Ensure you have the Rust toolchain (1.70+), Cargo, and `libnl` headers installed.
2. Clone and build:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/glolsh/sqm-autorate-rust-hybrid.git
   cd sqm-autorate-rust-hybrid
   cargo build --release
   ```
3. The optimized binary is at `target/release/sqm-autorate-rust`.

### 2. OpenWrt SDK build

1. **Prepare the OpenWrt SDK** for your target platform.
2. **Add the package** to your build system:
   ```bash
   # Create a custom feed or link the directory
   mkdir -p package/utils
   cp -r /path/to/sqm-autorate-rust-hybrid/openwrt-pkg package/utils/sqm-autorate-rust
   ```
3. **Configure and build**:
   ```bash
   make menuconfig  # Network -> sqm-autorate-rust-hybrid -> Enable
   make package/utils/sqm-autorate-rust/compile V=s
   ```
4. **Install on your device**:
   ```bash
   opkg install sqm-autorate-rust_*.ipk
   ```
